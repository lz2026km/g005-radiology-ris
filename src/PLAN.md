## Implementation Details

### 2.1 GPU-Accelerated 3D Rendering (30 pts)
- `VolumeRenderer.tsx` - WebGL-based volume ray-casting with transfer function controls (density, opacity, gradient)
- `SurfaceRenderer.tsx` - Marching-cubes surface generation with Phong shading & mesh export
- Synchronized camera across MPR/3D views

### 2.2 Advanced Image Processing (25 pts)
- `filterService.ts` - Gaussian, Median, Sobel, Bilateral filters with kernel-size control
- `reconstructionService.ts` - MIP, MinIP, VR slab reconstruction with variable thickness
- `aiEnhanceService.ts` - Denoising, super-resolution, artifact reduction stubs

### 2.3 Hanging Protocols & Workspace (25 pts)
- `protocolRegistry.ts` - Multi-criteria matching (modality, body part, clinical indication, prior studies)
- `workspaceManager.ts` - Multi-monitor layout persistence, drag-drop viewport arrangement, user presets

### 2.4 Image Quality Assurance (20 pts)
- `qaService.ts` - ACR/LungRADS/RECIST compliance checks, motion/blur detection, coverage validation
- `scoringEngine.ts` - Weighted scoring (SNR, CNR, uniformity, resolution) with configurable thresholds

### 2.5 Multi-Modality Fusion (20 pts)
- `FusionViewer.tsx` - Side-by-side, overlay, checkerboard, split-window fusion of CT/MR/PET
- `RegistrationPanel.tsx` - Rigid/affine/deformable registration with landmark-based refinement

### 2.6 Advanced Measurement (25 pts)
- `measurementEngine.ts` - RECIST 1.1, WHO, volumetric, perfusion, SUV measurements
- `reportingService.ts` - Structured Report (SR) generation, DICOM SR export, temporal comparison

### 2.7 DICOM Viewer Enhancements (25 pts)
- `displayService.ts` - HDR tone mapping, 10/12-bit display pipeline, calibration (DICOM GSDF)
- `synchronizationService.ts` - Frame-level, stack-level, study-level sync across linked viewports

### 2.8 Cloud 3D Post-Processing (20 pts)
- `cloudRenderService.ts` - GPU farm job submission, streaming render, progressive refinement
- `jobManager.ts` - Priority queue, cost tracking, auto-scaling, retry with backoff

### 2.9 Teaching & Research (20 pts)
- `TeachingFileBuilder.tsx` - Anonymized case export with annotations, DICOM de-identification, PDF/PPT generation
- `ResearchDashboard.tsx` - Cohort filtering, batch export, BI-RADS/Lung-RADS registry queries
